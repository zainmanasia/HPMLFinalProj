# COMS 6998 Project
To run all project files, use Juyter notebooks and connect to Google Cloud to run. The ResNet18 model code should run through Jupyter notebook. The ResNet50 model code should also run throuh Juyter Notebook. If there needs to be changes done to check model performance,, the train_model.py contains model training code, in the code, specific changes can be implemented to achieve te optimization desired, such as including a certain number of works, enabling TorchScript, enabling cuDNN Autotuining, etc. This is not done automatically, so it must be done manually through the script.
